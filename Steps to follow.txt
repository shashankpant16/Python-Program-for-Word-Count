1. Import all the requistic libraries i.e BeautifulSoup, requests, urllib, matplotlib.pyplot and pyspark.
2. Now enter the scraping url and get the request from the site.
3. After getting the request,  we will read the content of the website in this case "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning".
4. Selected a subtopic, here "Overview".
5. With the help of pyspark we can count the occurance of the word in that paragraph.
